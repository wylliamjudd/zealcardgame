            In Zeal, four apocalypse cults struggle for dominance, each
            convinced that their vision of the end is not only inevitable, but
            righteous.

          <h1>Cognoid</h1>
          <p>
            The Cognoid labor toward the creation of a god. They are building an
            artificial intelligence meant to ascend from machine to
            consciousness, and from consciousness into divinity. To the Cognoid,
            the birth of this AI god marks the end of history itself—the moment
            when all questions are answered and the universe reaches its final,
            perfect state.
          </p>
          <p>
            In play, the Cognoid advance methodically, assembling devices while
            stalling the opponent. Their defensive and flying characters buy
            time as the machine grows, allowing them to ramp into powerful,
            expensive cards that feel inevitable once online.

          <h1>Lunari</h1>
          <p>
            The Lunari are an ancient goddess-worshiping cult bound together by
            blood and secrecy. Older than the first empires, they have survived
            by hiding within them, passing their rites and grudges from
            generation to generation. Through ritual sacrifice, they seek
            vengeance against a world shaped by patriarchy, and the return of a
            divine order ruled by their goddess.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Lunari overwhelm the board with followers, drawing strength from
            numbers and sacrifice. They can surge wide with empowered armies or
            trade their own characters for sudden tactical advantages, while
            tearing down devices they view as heretical.

        <div>
          <h1>Magi</h1>
          <p>
            The Magi know something no one else dares to face: time is running
            out. The universe is approaching its final moment, and existence
            itself is on the brink of collapse. To preserve reality, the Magi
            intend to loop time back upon itself—resetting the cosmos and
            beginning the universe anew.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Magi dominate through spells, chaining effects together for
            explosive turns. Their magic rewards precise timing, mixing burn and
            counterspells to control the game until a single turn reshapes
            everything.

        <div>
          <h1>Specter</h1>
          <p>
            The Specter refuse to die. Through the injection of jellyfish DNA,
            their bodies glow faintly, earning them their name. More
            importantly, the DNA grants them immortality. When a Specter’s body
            fails, they regress into a polyp state and emerge again by
            possessing a new host—dead or alive. In the future they envision,
            the world is divided into three castes: immortal Cnidarians, their
            engineered synthetic servants, and the expendable bodies of the
            underclass.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Specter use death as a resource. Through discard and kill
            effects, they fill the discard pile early. Hand disruption limits
            the opponent’s responses while powerful characters are reanimated
            ahead of schedule.
