## Narrative Integration

The Greywick saga unfolds as a series of interconnected stories, starting with individual hero arcs (Stories 1–4), culminating in a major battle (*The Infernal Siege of Greywick*, assumed), and followed by sidequests and a new major adventure (Stories 5–10). The magic systems (Galvanism, Black Magik, Sanguimancy) and species (Ghost Elves, Grave Dwarves, Caulsight Halflings) deepen the lore, offering new mechanics and narrative depth. The artifacts and trinkets (Occult Artifacts, Dark Secrets & Trist Trinkets) provide rewards and challenges, tying into the gothic horror themes of forbidden knowledge, tragedy, and the struggle against darkness. The monsters reflect the rift’s corrupting influence, escalating from minor threats (Prismatic Slugs, Whispering Shadows) to major abominations (Sourwood Harbinger), driving the adventurers to protect Greywick at great personal cost.
